### Title: Need Transbase JDBC Driver for WIS Database Export

**Post:**
```
Hello everyone,

I have Mercedes WIS running in a VM and need to export the database for a Unimog community website project. The database is at C:\DB\WIS\wisnet\ with R0-R8 folders.

I've been trying to connect with DbVisualizer but I'm missing the Transbase JDBC driver (transbase.jar).

Connection details I have:
- Server: wisnet@localhost:2054
- User: tbadmin
- Password: (empty)

Can anyone:
1. Share the Transbase JDBC driver?
2. Point me to a working download link?
3. Or share an already extracted WIS database (CSV/SQL)?

This is for a non-commercial Unimog enthusiast community site to help owners repair their vehicles.

Thanks in advance!

### Title: Looking for WIS Database Export or Transbase Driver

**Post:**
```
Fellow Mercedes enthusiasts,

Building a free Unimog repair resource website. I have WIS/ASRA installed but can't export the database without the Transbase JDBC driver.

If anyone has:
- The transbase.jar JDBC driver
- An exported WIS database (any format)
- Alternative extraction method that works

Would greatly appreciate the help. This will benefit the entire Unimog community with free access to repair information.

PM me if you prefer.

Cheers!

Hi [username],

I saw your post about WIS database extraction. I'm building a free Unimog repair resource and need to extract the WIS database.

Could you possibly:
1. Share the Transbase JDBC driver?
2. Or share your extracted database?

Happy to contribute back to the community with whatever I extract.

Thanks!
