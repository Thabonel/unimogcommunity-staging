# ðŸŽ¯ FINAL SIMPLE SOLUTION - Get WIS Data Without Windows

Since Windows keeps crashing, here's what we'll do:

## Option 1: Use Your Existing WIS Extraction
You mentioned you already extracted files before. Let's find them:

```bash
find /Volumes/UnimogManuals -name "rfile*" -o -name "R0" -o -name "R1" 2>/dev/null
```

These rfiles contain all the WIS data - we just need to process them.

## Option 2: Download Pre-Extracted WIS Data
The Mercedes community has shared extracted WIS databases. You can download them from:

1. **MHH AUTO Forum**: https://mhhauto.com/
   - Search for "WIS database export"
   - Many users have shared CSV exports

2. **BenzWorld Forum**: https://www.benzworld.org/
   - DIY Section has WIS data exports

3. **Mercedes-Benz Forum**: https://mbworld.org/
   - Tech Help section

## Option 3: Use Sample Data to Build Structure
I can create the database structure with sample Unimog data, then you can fill it with real data later:

```javascript
// Import sample Unimog data to test the system
const sampleData = {
  procedures: [
    {
      procedure_code: 'U1300-001',
      title: 'Engine Oil Change',
      content: 'Drain oil, replace filter, refill with OM366LA spec oil...',
      model_codes: ['U1300L', 'U1700']
    }
  ],
  parts: [
    {
      part_number: 'A0001802609',
      description: 'Oil Filter OM366LA',
      applicable_models: ['U1300L', 'U1700']
    }
  ]
};
```

## Option 4: Simple File Server (When Windows Works)
When Windows boots successfully:
1. Copy C:\DB\WIS\wisnet to Desktop
2. Install Python: https://www.python.org/downloads/
3. Run: `python -m http.server 8000`
4. Download from Mac: `wget -r http://localhost:8000`

## What Do You Want To Do?

1. **Find your existing extracted files** (you mentioned copying them before)
2. **Download from community** (proven to work)
3. **Use sample data** to build the system now
4. **Wait and try Windows again later**

The important thing is to get your website working. The WIS data can be added incrementally.
