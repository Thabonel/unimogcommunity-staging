# Session Summary: Map Display Investigation
**Date**: August 28, 2025
**Issue**: Traffic & Emergency Alerts and Fires Near Me maps not displaying on staging
**Status**: Investigation Complete

## Investigation Summary

### Issue Reported
User reported that Traffic & Emergency Alerts and Fires Near Me maps were not showing in the staging environment, while Trip Planner maps were working correctly.

### Root Cause Analysis

Initially suspected the issue was related to module-level Mapbox token initialization conflicting with CSP headers (as documented in the August 27, 2025 fix). However, investigation revealed:

1. **SimpleMap.tsx** (used by Traffic & Emergency Alerts):
   - Token is CORRECTLY set inside useEffect on line 46
   - Already follows the proper pattern

2. **FiresMapView.tsx** (used by Fires Near Me):
   - Token is CORRECTLY set inside useEffect on line 98
   - Already follows the proper pattern

3. **Trip Planner maps** (WORKING):
   - Sets token inside functions/hooks
   - User explicitly stated not to touch these as they work perfectly

### Key Findings

#### Current State is Correct
Both problematic map components already have the correct implementation with tokens set inside useEffect hooks, not at module level. The August 27, 2025 fix appears to have been successfully applied.

#### Files Reviewed
- ✅ `src/components/SimpleMap.tsx` - Correct implementation
- ✅ `src/components/dashboard/fires/FiresMapView.tsx` - Correct implementation
- ✅ `src/components/user/TrafficEmergencyDisplay.tsx` - Uses SimpleMap correctly
- ❌ `src/components/SimpleMap 2.tsx` - Has module-level token (line 11) but is NOT imported anywhere

#### Other Potential Issues to Investigate

Since the code appears correct, the issue may be:

1. **Environment Variable Issue**:
   - `VITE_MAPBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN` might not be set in Netlify staging environment
   - Token might be invalid or expired

2. **CSP Headers**:
   - Staging CSP headers might be more restrictive than expected
   - May need to add `'wasm-unsafe-eval'` for Mapbox workers

3. **Build/Deployment**:
   - Code might not be properly deployed to staging
   - Build cache might need clearing

4. **Runtime Errors**:
   - Check browser console on staging site for specific errors
   - MapboxGL worker initialization might still be failing

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. Verify `VITE_MAPBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN` is set in Netlify staging environment variables
2. Check browser console on staging site for specific error messages
3. Clear Netlify build cache and redeploy
4. Test token validity using Mapbox API directly

### If Issue Persists
1. Review Netlify staging CSP headers in netlify.toml
2. Consider temporarily adding `'unsafe-eval'` to CSP for testing
3. Check if there are differences between staging and production Netlify configurations
4. Monitor network tab for failed Mapbox worker loads

## Code Quality Notes
- Found duplicate file `SimpleMap 2.tsx` with old module-level token initialization
- This file is not imported anywhere and can be safely deleted
- All active map components follow best practices for token initialization

## Conclusion
The code implementation appears correct with tokens properly set inside useEffect hooks. The issue is likely environmental (missing/invalid token, CSP configuration, or deployment issue) rather than a code problem.
