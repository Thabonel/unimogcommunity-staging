# WIS Visual Extraction - SOLVED with UTM

## ‚úÖ The Working Solution: UTM on Apple Silicon Mac

### Problem Identified
- **Your Mac**: Apple Silicon (ARM64) - M1/M2 processor
- **VirtualBox 7.1.4**: Cannot run x86 Windows VMs on ARM64 Macs
- **WIS VM**: Windows 7 32-bit (x86 architecture)
- **Error**: `VBOX_E_PLATFORM_ARCH_NOT_SUPPORTED`

### Why UTM Succeeded
UTM (Universal Turing Machine) is specifically designed for Apple Silicon Macs:
- **Built for ARM64**: Native Apple Silicon application
- **x86 Emulation**: Uses QEMU for proper x86 emulation on ARM
- **Architecture Bridge**: Can run both ARM and x86 guest systems
- **VDI Compatible**: Direct support for VirtualBox disk images

### The Successful Process

1. **UTM Installation**
   ```bash
   brew install --cask utm
   ```
   Or download from: https://mac.getutm.app

2. **VM Configuration in UTM**
   - Import: `/Volumes/UnimogManuals/wis-extraction/MERCEDES.vdi`
   - System: Windows 7 (x86)
   - Memory: 2GB RAM
   - Architecture: x86 (emulated)

3. **Shared Folder Setup**
   - Created shared folder to `/Volumes/UnimogManuals/wis-data`
   - Enabled bidirectional file transfer
   - Windows 7 can access Mac files directly

4. **WIS Access Achieved**
   - Windows 7 booted successfully ‚úÖ
   - WIS application accessible ‚úÖ
   - Manual data located and accessible ‚úÖ
   - Files copied to shared folder for Mac access ‚úÖ

## üìä Architecture Comparison

| Component | VirtualBox 7.x | UTM |
|-----------|---------------|-----|
| Mac Architecture | ARM64 (Apple Silicon) | ARM64 (Apple Silicon) |
| x86 Support | ‚ùå No emulation | ‚úÖ QEMU emulation |
| Windows 7 32-bit | ‚ùå Incompatible | ‚úÖ Fully supported |
| Performance | N/A - Won't run | Good with emulation |
| Shared Folders | N/A | ‚úÖ Working |

## üéØ Key Success Factors

1. **UTM's QEMU Backend**: Provides proper x86 emulation layer
2. **Native ARM64 App**: Built specifically for Apple Silicon
3. **VDI Support**: Direct import without conversion
4. **Shared Folders**: Easy file transfer between guest and host

## üìÅ Current Setup

- **VM Location**: UTM application
- **VDI Path**: `/Volumes/UnimogManuals/wis-extraction/MERCEDES.vdi`
- **Shared Folder**: `/Volumes/UnimogManuals/wis-data`
- **OS**: Windows 7 32-bit (x86) - running via emulation
- **WIS Status**: Fully accessible ‚úÖ

## üí° Why VirtualBox Failed on Apple Silicon

VirtualBox on Apple Silicon Macs:
- Runs through Rosetta 2 (Intel emulation layer)
- Cannot emulate x86 within already-emulated environment
- Architecture mismatch: ARM64 ‚Üí Rosetta 2 ‚Üí x86 VM = ‚ùå

UTM on Apple Silicon Macs:
- Native ARM64 application
- Direct x86 emulation via QEMU
- Architecture path: ARM64 ‚Üí QEMU ‚Üí x86 VM = ‚úÖ

## üöÄ Next Steps

With UTM successfully running the WIS VM:
1. Access WIS application in Windows 7
2. Navigate to visual content sections
3. Export diagrams and manuals
4. Copy to shared folder for Mac access
5. Process and upload to Supabase

## üìù Lesson Learned

**For Apple Silicon Macs + x86 VMs**: UTM is the solution, not VirtualBox.
