## How to Test

### 1. Quick Test
```bash
# 1. Add your OpenAI API key to .env
echo "VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-key-here" >> .env

# 2. Start the development server
npm run dev

# 3. Navigate to the test page
# http://localhost:5173/test-chatgpt
```

### 2. Main Integration Test
1. Go to **Knowledge Base** > **AI Mechanic**
2. Barry should greet you with his characteristic personality
3. Try asking technical questions about Unimogs

### 3. Verify Old Infrastructure Removed
1. Check that Steve Travel Planner is gone from Knowledge Base
2. Verify no Botpress scripts are loading in browser console
3. Confirm webhook setup page shows integration removed message

## Test Questions for Barry

Try these questions to verify the integration:
1. "How do I check portal oil levels on a U1300L?"
2. "What's causing a whining noise from my front axle?"
3. "Explain the torque tube maintenance schedule"
4. "What tire pressure should I use for sand driving?"

## Configuration Files

### Required Environment Variable
```bash
# .env
VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-openai-api-key
```

### Key Files Modified/Created
- `/src/services/chatgpt/chatgptService.ts` - Core ChatGPT service
- `/src/components/knowledge/BarryChat.tsx` - New chat UI component
- `/src/hooks/use-chatgpt.ts` - React hook for chat functionality
- `/src/pages/KnowledgeBase.tsx` - Updated to remove Steve
- `/src/pages/TestChatGPT.tsx` - Test page for verification

## Production Considerations

⚠️ **Important**: The current implementation uses the API key directly in the browser. For production:

1. Create a backend API endpoint to proxy OpenAI requests
2. Implement user authentication checks
3. Add rate limiting per user
4. Monitor API usage and costs
5. Consider implementing a token budget system

See `/docs/CHATGPT_SETUP.md` for detailed production setup instructions.

## Next Steps

1. **Add API Key**: Get your OpenAI API key and add it to `.env`
2. **Test Integration**: Navigate to `/test-chatgpt` to verify setup
3. **Try Barry**: Go to Knowledge Base > AI Mechanic
4. **Monitor Usage**: Keep an eye on your OpenAI dashboard for API usage

## Troubleshooting

### Barry Not Responding
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify API key is correctly set in `.env`
- Ensure you have API credits in OpenAI account
- Check if you've hit rate limits

### Configuration Issues
- API key must start with `sk-`
- Restart dev server after adding `.env`
- Clear browser cache if needed

## Success Metrics
✅ Barry responds with Unimog expertise
✅ Maintains characteristic personality
✅ Provides detailed technical answers
✅ Handles errors gracefully
✅ Shows proper loading states

The ChatGPT integration is now complete and ready for testing!
