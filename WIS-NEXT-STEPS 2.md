# WIS EPC Integration - Next Steps

## Current Status âœ…
1. **Database Ready**: WIS content tables created in Supabase
2. **Sample Data**: Working sample procedures and parts data
3. **Viewer Working**: Live at http://localhost:5173/knowledge/wis-epc
4. **VM Registered**: MERCEDES VM added to VirtualBox
5. **Shared Folder**: Configured for data extraction

## Issue with VDI Extraction ðŸš§
The MERCEDES.vdi file extraction keeps stopping at 3.77GB out of 53.5GB. This appears to be a recurring issue with the large archive.

## Recommended Approach ðŸŽ¯

### Option 1: Work with Sample Data (Immediate)
The system is already functional with sample data. You can:
1. Visit http://localhost:5173/knowledge/wis-epc
2. Search for procedures (e.g., "oil change", "brake")
3. View parts and diagrams
4. This proves the Supabase-first architecture works!

### Option 2: Manual Extraction (1-2 hours)
Run the extraction in a dedicated terminal:
```bash
cd /Volumes/EDIT/wis-extraction
nohup bash -c "7z x Mercedes09.7z.001 MERCEDES.vdi -y > extraction.log 2>&1" &
```

Monitor progress:
```bash
tail -f /Volumes/EDIT/wis-extraction/extraction.log
```

### Option 3: Try VM with Partial VDI
Since the VM is registered, you could try:
1. Open VirtualBox GUI
2. Select MERCEDES VM
3. Settings â†’ Storage â†’ Check disk configuration
4. Try starting the VM (it might work with partial file)

### Option 4: Alternative Data Sources
Instead of extracting the full 53.5GB:
1. Do you have the original WIS/EPC installation files?
2. Or access to a Windows PC with WIS already installed?
3. We could copy just the data files (much smaller)

## What's Already Working ðŸš€
- **Search**: Full-text search across procedures
- **Filter**: By model and system
- **View**: Procedures with steps and required parts
- **Data Model**: Ready for full WIS data import

## Production Deployment Path
1. **Current**: Sample data in Supabase (working now)
2. **Next**: Extract real WIS data when VDI is ready
3. **Deploy**: â‚¬5/month Linux VPS for PDF generation
4. **Scale**: Add more procedures based on usage

## My Recommendation ðŸ’¡
Start using the system with sample data while the full extraction runs in the background. Your 500 community members can already benefit from:
- Common Unimog procedures
- Parts lookup
- Basic troubleshooting guides

The architecture is proven and ready - we just need the full data extraction to complete.

Would you like to:
1. **Use sample data** and add more procedures manually?
2. **Try background extraction** with the script?
3. **Explore alternative** data sources?
4. **Start VPS setup** for production deployment?
