## What Was Fixed
âœ… Removed 50+ duplicate Supabase client files
âœ… Standardized all imports to use single Supabase client
âœ… Added session clearing for corrupted auth
âœ… Fixed infinite re-render loops in profile hooks
âœ… Fixed memory leak in vehicle dashboard
âœ… Created SQL migration for missing database tables

## If Still Having Issues
The migration script fixes:
- Missing storage buckets (profile_photos, avatars, etc.)
- Missing user_activities table
- Missing user_subscriptions table
- Row Level Security policies
- Profile table missing columns

## Files Changed
- `src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx` - Added session clearing
- `src/hooks/profile/use-profile-fetcher.ts` - Fixed imports
- `src/hooks/vehicle-maintenance/useFetchVehicles.ts` - Fixed memory leak
- All 162 files with incorrect imports - Fixed to use @/lib/supabase-client

## Next Steps
After applying the SQL migration, your app should work properly. The profile page will load, and you can log in without errors.
