# Deployment Status Report

## ✅ RESOLVED: Favicon and Hero Image Issues

### Current Status
- **Netlify Subdomain**: ✅ WORKING - https://unimogcommunityhub.netlify.app
  - Favicon: ✅ Loading correctly
  - Hero Image: ✅ Loading from Supabase
  - React App: ✅ Fully functional

- **Custom Domain**: ⚠️ CONFIGURATION NEEDED - https://unimoghub.com
  - Currently showing a different site with redirect to "/lander"
  - This is NOT your React app

### What Was Fixed
1. ✅ Removed all lovable-tagger references
2. ✅ Fixed build errors (supabase import issues)
3. ✅ Verified favicon files are in public folder and tracked in git
4. ✅ Confirmed hero image loads from Supabase URL
5. ✅ Successfully built and deployed to Netlify

### Assets Verification
```bash
# Run this to verify assets on any domain:
./scripts/verify-production-assets.sh [domain]

# Current results:
./scripts/verify-production-assets.sh https://unimogcommunityhub.netlify.app
✅ All assets loading correctly
```

### Custom Domain Configuration Needed

The issue with unimoghub.com is that it's pointing to a different site/service. You need to:

1. **Check Domain DNS Settings**
   - Ensure unimoghub.com is pointing to Netlify
   - Should have CNAME record pointing to unimogcommunityhub.netlify.app
   
2. **In Netlify Dashboard**
   - Go to Site Settings > Domain Management
   - Add custom domain: unimoghub.com
   - Follow Netlify's instructions for DNS configuration

3. **Alternative: Domain Redirect Service**
   - The current "/lander" redirect suggests the domain might be parked or using a redirect service
   - Check with your domain registrar

### Hero Image Configuration
The hero image is correctly configured to load from:
```
https://ydevatqwkoccxhtejdor.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/site_assets/2828a9e2-f57a-4737-b4b6-a24cfc14a95a.png
```

This URL is hardcoded in `/src/components/home/HeroSection.tsx` and working correctly.

### Summary
Your React app is fully functional and deployed correctly to Netlify. The favicon and hero image issues are RESOLVED. The only remaining issue is configuring the custom domain (unimoghub.com) to point to your Netlify deployment instead of whatever service is currently showing the "/lander" redirect.
