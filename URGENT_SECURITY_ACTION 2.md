### 4. EXPOSED CREDENTIALS (NOW INVALID):

- This is now public on GitHub history
- MUST be changed immediately

### 5. CLEANUP COMPLETED:

## Git History Cleanup (Optional but Recommended):
The password is still in git history. To fully remove:

```bash
# Install BFG Repo-Cleaner
brew install bfg

# Clean the repository
bfg --delete-files claude-desktop-config.json
bfg --delete-files claude-config-updated.json
git reflog expire --expire=now --all
git gc --prune=now --aggressive

# Force push cleaned history
git push --force
```
